## Unseen Warfare 

Quotation from Cap 40.

> Do you believe that the words of your Lord: ‘Take up thy cross” refer also to you personally? 
If you believe this, then take it up.
The Lord has laid it on your shoulders in the present grievous case. 
Do not say, it is too heavy; God knows better the measure of your strength. 
To some God sends trials and sorrows, brought about by circumstances and in no way dependent on people; 
these are more easily borne. 
To others He sends those causes by people, and they are harder, especially when we cannot take the grief caused to us as unintentional, and still harder when we have done some good to those people. 
The last case is the hardest to bear. 
If God sends you this, know that it is precisely what is most useful for you, and to this realisation add the inspiring thought: 
God sees that you are strong enough to bear it and expects you actually to bear it with a good heart, without complaining. 
So do not disappoint God’s expectation.

> I must add that God prefers us to endure afflictions coming from the evil nature of people, especially from those to whom we have
done some good, rather than those which are the accidental result of unfavourable circumstances. 
Why? 
Because our native pride is more easily subdued and exterminated by the former than by the latter. 
And also because, if obedience to God’s will is the chief thing in our spiritual doing, there is no better way of provoking and manifesting it to a greater degree than in such cases, if we bear them with a good heart, giving warm thanks to God for sending them, since they are truly a great blessing, thus testifying to our complete obedience to the Divine will, and to an ardent zeal in conforming ourselves in everything to this will. 
This disposition precedes the visitation of rigorous trials. Seeing the birth of such a disposition and wishing to make it stronger and more deeply rooted, God sends us a cup of the strongest temptations, which, when borne with willingness, good heart and gladness, always brings this blessed spiritual fruit. 
Therefore, knowing this, wishing and seeking it, we must accept this cup from the hands of God, shutting the eyes of inquisitiveness, and, with complete faith, clearly see in it the great love of God for us and the assurance of
our spiritual progress. 
Thus we must drain it with joy, the more willingly the more bitter is its taste.
