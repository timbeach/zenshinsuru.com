Our Father, Who art in the heavens, hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us form the evil one.

_Psalm 50_

Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgressions. 
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
For I know mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. 
Against Thee only have I sinned and done this evil before Thee, that Thou mightest be justified in Thy words, and prevail when Thou art judged. 
For behold, I was conceived in inquitities, and in sins did my mother bear me. 
For behold, Thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of Thy wisdom hast Thou made manifest unto me. 
Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean; 
Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. 
Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; 
the bones that be humbled, they shall rejoice. 
Turn Thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. 
Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. 
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation and with Thy governing Spirit establish me. 
I shall teach trangressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall turn back unto Thee. 
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness. 
O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise. 
For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I had given it; 
with whole-burnt offerings Thou shalt not be pleased. 
A sacrifice unto God is a broken spirit; a heart that is broken and humbled God will not despise. 
Do good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Sion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be builded. 
Then shalt Thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole-burnt offerings. 
Then shall they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.

_The Symbol of Faith_

I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. 
And in on Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages;
Light of light; true God of true God; begotten of the Father before all ages;
of one essence with the Father; by Whom all things were made;
Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from the heavens, 
and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man; 
And was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried;
And arose again on the third day according to the Scriptures;
And ascended into the heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; 
And shall come again with glory, to judge both the living and the dead;
Whose kingdom shall have no end.
And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life; 
Who proceedeth from the Father;
Who with the Father, and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spake by the prophets.
In One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.
I confess one baptism for the remission of sins. 
I look for the resurrection from the dead, And the life of the age to come. Amen
