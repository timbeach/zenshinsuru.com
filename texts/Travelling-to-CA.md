I'm planning to travel Monday, Oct 28th and return Friday, Nov 15th. (I wanted to be sure to be back in town for our parish feast day!)

I'll be staying with my mother at 1385 Velma Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95403, and I'm planning to drive my mother to my sister's home near Sacramento on Nov 7th. I may stay with her there overnight. 

These are the places I've researched so far that I would like to hopefully visit while I'm there: 

## Santa Rosa

Saints Peter and Paul Russian Orthodox Church
850 St Olga Ct, Santa Rosa, CA 95407
This is only ~5 miles from my mother's home. I would like to attend Sunday Liturgy with my mother for her first Orthodox service. 

Holy Dormition
1521 Rose Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95407
This is only ~3 miles from my mother's home. It is a Bulgarian parish that has evening services, it looks like every day, so I would like to attend these frequently during my visit.

St. Seraphim of Sarov Orthodox Cathedral
90 Mountain View Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95407
This is another OCA parish ~9 miles from my mother's home, that I probably won't attend unless my mother expresses interest in experiencing another, local Orthodox parish.

## San Francisco

Holy Virgin Cathedral in SF 
6210 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94121
I reached out to the warden via email who confirmed I could come to venerate St John. I'm planning to go straight from the airport on Monday to the cathedral.

## Near Sacramento

Holy Virgin Mary Antiochian
3060 Jefferson Blvd, West Sacramento, CA 95691
While I'm in Sacramento area, I would like to attend Fr Paul Baba's parish, or perhaps make a special trip for Vespers or Liturgy

Elevation of the Holy Cross
9000 Jackson Rd, Sacramento, CA 95826
This appears to be an OCA parish. The reason for desiring attending here is to go with a work colleague who has expressed interest in the Church, lives nearby and wants to attend for the first time.

## Near Red Bluff

St. Herman of Alaska Monastery
10 Beegum Gorge Rd, Platina, CA 96076
My paternal grandparents lived in Red Bluff the entire time I knew them while they were alive. I didn't realize until a few years ago how close Platina is.
I would very much like to do at least a day visit to the monastery, most likely during the weekend of Nov 8, 9, 10.
