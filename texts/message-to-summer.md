Summer, Summer's Husband & Jen,

Greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ.

My name is Timothy Beach. 
Husband of Tara, and father of Ezra and Elliott.

Summer, please include your husband in this conversation. I regretfully don't know his name.

I believe we should bring into the light any bad feelings or slander that seems to have worked its way into our midst. 
I love you and your families, and I desire nothing but the blessings of our Lord upon you.

I will describe the incident that occurred Monday, September 23rd between Elliott, Brooklyn, and myself. As I understand it, there is some history between Elliott and Brooklyn wherein we feel that Elliott has been hurt and name-called to the point where Elliott has experienced real dread of the prospect of seeing Brooklyn. I have documented these cases as carefully as I could, and I can provide details if you like. I hope we are not at a place where that will be required. When Brooklyn chased Elliott last Monday, I don't believe there was any malice in his intentions. However, the impact on Elliott was very real, and as a father, I must address this situation to ensure his well-being. I would like to ask that we work together to foster a more positive environment for our children.

I don't want to believe it, but I understand that Brooklyn has slandered me by saying that I called him a "jerk." Let me assure you, the only words I said to him were, "Look in my eyes. Leave Elliott alone" which Tara was in hear-shot to hear. Based on the tears and terror on Elliott's face, my body language was probably too intense. Forgive me. I did not do the "I'm watching motion you" motion. I wanted to get eye contact to make sure he was listening and understood me clearly. Imagine if you will, one of your sons rounding a corner with tears and terror on his face while another boy is chasing him and won't stop. I dare say, you might step in between them and ask the one chasing to leave your son alone.

As I understand it, although, I don't want to believe it, I understand that Brooklyn has called Elliott a, "fucker" and other such derogatory names. I understand there have been several incidents of Brooklyn bullying Elliott, of which Tara has decided not to mention to anyone. I've also heard, that Brooklyn has said to Elliott, "My mom said not to buy from you because you're a scammer and a fucker" with regard to selling his peppermints, which he no longer does because that upset him so much. This is too much for Tara, and she wishes to be left out of it. Tara and I really just want everyone to be friends.

I understand that misunderstandings and conflicts can arise between children, and my intention is not to assign blame but to seek a resolution that is rooted in understanding, kindness, and the values we hold dear. I am open to meeting with you both, so that we can discuss how to best support our children moving forward. I believe that by coming together, we can help them grow in love, compassion, and respect for one another. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to hearing from you. 

In Christ's love, 
Timothy Beach
